            <div>
                <p>Hey there! My tech journey kicked off in 2018 when I chose Computer Engineering for my Diploma. I
                    wrapped up my undergrad in Computer Engineering in July 2024, and since then, I&apos;ve been working
                    full-time at Noovosoft.</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>I first joined Noovosoft as an intern in August 2023, and after a year of hands-on
                    experience, I transitioned into a full-time role in August 2024. These days, you&apos;ll find me tackling
                    exciting projects for Noovosoft&apos;s clients, constantly learning, and leveling up my skills. ðŸš€</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>But hey, life&apos;s not just about code! When I&apos;m not deep in development, you&apos;ll
                    probably find me on the cricket field or hanging out with friends. Because balance is key,
                    right?</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>So, here&apos;s to a mix of tech, learning, and a bit of cricket. Cheers! ðŸŒŸ</p>
