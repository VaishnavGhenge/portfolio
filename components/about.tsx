                <p>Hey there! I kicked off my journey into the tech world back in 2018 when I decided to roll with Computer Engineering as my jam for my Diploma. Fast forward to today, and I'm cruising through my fourth and final year of undergrad studies in Computer Engineering.</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>These days, you'll catch me diving into exciting projects for Noovosoft's clients while juggling the academic hustle. Strike that balance, you know? ðŸš€</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>But hey, life's not all about code! When I'm not staring at a screen, I'm out there on the cricket field giving it my all or just kicking back with friends. Because, let's face it, balance is the real MVP.</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>So, here's to the blend of tech life, academic adventures, and the occasional cricket match. Cheers! ðŸŒŸ</p>
