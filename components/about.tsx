            <div>
                <p>Hey there! My tech journey kicked off in 2018 when I chose Computer Engineering for my Diploma. I
                    wrapped up my undergrad in Computer Engineering in July 2024, and since then, I've been working
                    full-time at Noovosoft.</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>I first joined Noovosoft as an intern in August 2023, and after a year of hands-on
                    experience, I transitioned into a full-time role in August 2024. These days, youâ€™ll find me tackling
                    exciting projects for Noovosoftâ€™s clients, constantly learning, and leveling up my skills. ðŸš€</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>But hey, lifeâ€™s not just about code! When Iâ€™m not deep in development, youâ€™ll
                    probably find me on the cricket field or hanging out with friends. Because balance is key,
                    right?</p>
                <p className='mt-4'>So, hereâ€™s to a mix of tech, learning, and a bit of cricket. Cheers! ðŸŒŸ</p>
